Michael McKay, Theola Booker, Yolanda \n        Adams, Edwin and Walter Hawkins, Sandi Patty, The Winans, Kathy Taylor, \n        and Brenda Waters, Carl Preacher, Shirley Joiner of B, C & S;\nWhereas many of the biggest names in music emerged from the gospel music \n        tradition or have recorded gospel music, including Sam Cooke, Al Green, \n        Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Little \n        Richard, Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, Mariah \n        Carey, Bob Dylan, and Randy Travis;\nWhereas, regardless of their musical styles, those artists and so many more have \n        turned to gospel music as the source and inspiration for their music, \n        which has blurred the boundaries between secular and gospel music;\nWhereas, beyond its contribution to the musical tradition of the United States, \n        gospel music has provided a cultural and musical backdrop across all of \n        mainstream media, from hit television series to major Hollywood motion \n        pictures, including ``American Idol'', ``Heroes'', ``Dancing with the \n        Stars'', ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'', ``Sister Act'', ``The \n        Preacher's Wife'', ``Evan Almighty'', and more;\nWhereas gospel music has a huge audience around the country and around the \n        world, a testament to the universal appeal of a historical American art \n        form that both inspires and entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, \n        and geographic boundaries; and\nWhereas September 2012 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Gospel \n        Music Heritage Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled, That Congress supports the \ndesignation of ``Gospel Music Heritage Month'', which would recognize \nthe contributions to the culture of the United States derived from the \nrich heritage of gospel music and gospel music artists.\n                                 <all>\n\n"
